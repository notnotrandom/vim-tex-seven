TeX-7 is a ftplugin that aims to enhance the writing experience of high
quality documents with LaTeX and Vim. The goal of TeX-7 is to be simple
and Vimish, meaning that focus is on carefully thought-out key mappings
and features that are already present in a typical Vim installation. If
you need to write a thesis or research articles and insist on having
only one editor for all editing tasks, then TeX-7 is for you!

The main features of TeX-7 are:

* Powerful text-object for LaTeX environments 
* Omni-completion of BibTeX database entries and label references
* Omni-completion of mathematical symbols, and included files
* Preview of BibTeX database entries and label references
* Preview of \includegraphics (supported formats: JPG, PNG, or PDF)
* Filetype specific indentation (courtesy of Johannes Tanzler)
* No-hassle settings, relatively few mappings
* Supports distraction-free LaTeX "small compile", done when saving

A no hassle vim plugin for writing LaTeX documents. See section 2 of doc/tex_seven.txt for a quick overview of features.

Initially this was a fork of Elias Toivanen's TeX-9 plugin (https://github.com/vim-scripts/TeX-9). Its minimalistic spirit is, I hope, left unchanged.

Shoutout & thanks:
