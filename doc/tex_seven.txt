                          A semi-automatic, minimalistic
                                  LaTeX ftplugin                               
                          that does not get in your way!

    TeX-7 is a ftplugin that aims to enhance the writing experience of high
    quality documents with LaTeX and Vim. The goal of TeX-7 is to be simple
    and Vimish, meaning that focus is on carefully thought-out key mappings
    and features that are already present in a typical Vim installation. If
    you need to write a thesis or research articles and insist on having
    only one editor for all editing tasks, then TeX-7 is for you!

     The main features of TeX-7 are
        * Powerful text-object for LaTeX environments 
        * Omni-completion of BibTeX database entries and label references
        * Omni-completion of mathematical symbols
        * Filetype specific indentation (courtesy of Johannes Tanzler)
        * No-hassle settings, relatively few mappings

==============================================================================

1.  Installation                                    *tex_seven-installation*

    TeX-7 is distributed as a gzipped tarball. Unzip it to your local
    runtime path, usually `~/.vim/'.

    Next, open up |vimrc| and ensure it contains the following line:
    >
        filetype plugin indent on
<
    For basic usage you don't need to configure anything else. However,
    you may tweak some features of TeX-7 by defining a |Dictionary| called
    `g:tex_seven_config' in your vimrc (or better yet, in
    $VIMRUNTIME/ftplugin/tex.vim). The following keys are recognized:

    leader: String
        *   Most TeX-7 mappings begin with this prefix
        *   Optional
        *   Default: The values of |mapleader|  and |maplocalleader| are
            honored. Otherwise set to colon ':'.

    viewer: String
        *   Application used for viewing documents.
        *   Optional
        *   Default: 'xdg-open'
    
    disable: Boolean
        * TeX-7 is disabled temporarily.
        * Default: 0 (TeX-7 is loaded)

    diamond_tex: Boolean
        * TeX-9's originally mapped <LocalLeader>< to \leq, and <LocalLeader>> to \geq. However, I find these LaTeX commands actually easy to type, to I prefer to map <LocalLeader>< to nothing, and <LocalLeader>> to <> (sometimes called diamond). Among other things, this is useful when writing Beamer templates.
        * Default: 0 (map <LocalLeader>> to <>)

    Examples: >

    " Old school LaTeX user    
    let g:tex_seven_config = {
        \'compiler': 'latex',
        \'viewer': {'app':'xdvi', 'target':'dvi'},
    \}

    " A MacVim user
    let g:tex_seven_config = {
            \'compiler': 'pdflatex',
            \'viewer': {'app':'open', 'target':'pdf'},
    \}

2.  Basics                                          *tex_seven-basics*

    TeX-7 defines various mappings that speed up typesetting LaTeX code. Most
    of the mappings are prefixed with a leader referred below with the symbol
    <LocalLeader>. If you have set `g:tex_seven_config.leader',
    |maplocalleader| or |mapleader|, the corresponding character is used.
    Otherwise, the leader defaults to colon (:).

    TeX-7 uses relative paths in several places; hence, especially for
    multi-file projects, it is recommended to lauch `(g)vim' from the same
    folder where the main `.tex' file is located.

    Below is a short tutorial that should get you going in no time. Users who
    want to use SyncTeX, split their LaTeX manuscripts in several files and/or
    use different kinds of LaTeX compilers at the same time should also read
    the |tex_seven-advanced| section.

2.1. Insert mode

    Type <LocalLeader>M to get a popup list of different maths symbols. In
    addition, the most frequently used maths symbols have their own
    shortcuts.  Typing <LocalLeader>a expands to \alpha for example. Refer
    to |tex_seven-mappings| for a complete listing.

    Type <LocalLeader>C to insert a citation, i.e. `\cite{citekey}'. You're
    prompted with a popup list of completions if the \bibliography{} statement
    contains a valid BibTeX file (see |tex_seven-bibtex| for details). Inserting
    references, `\ref{ref}', works in a similar way. The corresponding mapping is
    <LocalLeader>R.

    To insert an environment, press <LocalLeader>B. You're prompted for an
    environment name and if a corresponding LaTeX code snippet was defined,
    it is inserted into the file (see |tex_seven-snippets|).

2.2. Normal mode

    Typing <LocalLeader>V should open the document in your desktop's default
    PDF viewer, if you didn't set `g:tex_seven_config.viewer' to something
    else.

==============================================================================

3.  Advanced                                        *tex_seven-advanced*

3.1. Multi-file projects

    The traditional way to handle multi-file projects is to set up a Makefile
    and compile with `make'. TeX-7 supports this behavior via the
    `g:tex_seven_config.compiler' option which can be set to `make'.

    You can save yourself the trouble of writing a Makefile by indicating the
    relative location of the main file in the \include-ed files with a modeline
    of the form
>
    % mainfile: MAIN_FILE
<
    The string MAIN_FILE could be for example `../main.tex' if the included
    file is in a subdirectory of the actual compilation folder. The modeline
    must appear in the first block of commented lines at the start of the
    document. Note that this assumes that line number 1 is commented. This way
    all the TeX-7 mappings continue to work as expected wherever you are in
    your project.

    NB! Make sure the filename MAIN_FILE does not contain any whitespace!

4.  Snippets                                        *tex_seven-snippets*

    TODO my own fork of sanders' snipmate.

==============================================================================

5.  BibTeX                                          *tex_seven-bibtex*

    In addition to citekey completion (see insert mode above), TeX-7 provides
    a preview feature
    that makes it easier to work with BibTeX and LaTeX files in the same
    Vim session. You may take a quick peek at a particular BibTeX entry
    by pressing `gb' over its citekey, i.e. \cite{citekey}. This command
    is in line with ||gd|| and  |gf| with the exception that the BibTeX
    entry is shown in a  |preview-window||.


==============================================================================

6.  Mappings                                        *tex_seven-mappings*

    The symbol <LocalLeader> refers to the value of
    `g:tex_seven_config.leader', |maplocalleader|. If none of
    these are set, the default value is colon ':'.

6.1 Insert mode >

        <LocalLeader><LocalLeader>          <LocalLeader>
        <LocalLeader>M                      Maths completion

        <LocalLeader>Â»                      \rangle

        The choice for some mappings, that start with a forward slash
        '/', might seem odd. The reason is for when are multiple choices,
        e.g. for the letters phi and epsilon. In those cases, I put the
        version I prefer best (e.g. \varphi) with the most natural
        mapping (<LocalLeader>f), and the other one (\phi) with the
        "slashed" mapping (<LocalLeader>/f). Of course, this means Vim
        will introduce a slight delay before expanding <LocalLeader>/
        (to see if it is actually any of the other mappings that also
        start with a '/'). But as I do not use <LocalLeader>/ much (this
        is a case I prefer to deal with a snippet from snipMate), this
        doesn't bother me much.

6.2 Normal Mode >

        gd              Go from \ref to the corresponding \label declaration, or from \cite to the corresponding entry in bibliography file.
        gp              Same as gp, but open a preview window.
        <LocalLeader>V  View the document

6.3 Visual Mode

        You can change the font style using these mappings:

        vmap <buffer><expr> <Leader>bf tex_seven#ChangeFontStyle('bf')
        vmap <buffer><expr> <Leader>it tex_seven#ChangeFontStyle('it')
        vmap <buffer><expr> <Leader>rm tex_seven#ChangeFontStyle('rm')
        vmap <buffer><expr> <Leader>sf tex_seven#ChangeFontStyle('sf')
        vmap <buffer><expr> <Leader>tt tex_seven#ChangeFontStyle('tt')
        vmap <buffer>       <Leader>up di\text{}<Left><C-R>"

        For example, to convert the word under the cursor to boldface, type
        >
            viw<Leader>bf

6.4 Extras

    TeX-7 comes with a custom `environment operator' (see ||text-objects||).
    Press 'vie' or 'vae' in normal normal to highlight the current inner
    environment (without the \begin and \end statements) or the outer
    environment respectively. Replace 'v' with another operator to achieve
    yanking, changing or deleting etc. For example, typing 'dae' makes it
    trivial to move figures and tables around in the document. Delete the
    environment, find a new location and paste it back to the buffer!
    
    There are also some macros that work by tapping a character on your
    keyboard (super convenient for subscripts and superscripts!).     

    >
        ^^ -> ^{}
        __ -> _{}
        ~~ -> \approx
        == -> &=
<
    Finally, try omni-completion () inside curly braces when you're
    including a picture with `\includegraphics{}': you'll get a listing of
    pictures in the compilation folder. Supported picture formats are EPS,
    PDF, JPG and PNG.

7.  Tips and tricks                                  *tex_seven-tips*

7.1.    Preferred way to override, extend and hack TeX-7

        Create a custom tex.vim file in the after directory, i.e.
        ~/.vim/after/ftplugin/tex.vim. Here you can redefine mappings and
        extend TeX-7's functionality with your own ideas. If you come up with
        something sweet, drop me a line (email address available at
        https://randomwalk.eu).

        Notice that to redefine mappings, you need need to set <LocalLeader>
        again. As an example, here is my ~/.vim/after/ftplugin/tex.vim:

        " First, reset <LocalLeader>. Note that this will run *after* TeX-7,
        " and hence that variable b:tex_seven_leader will be set.
        if exists('g:maplocalleader')
          let s:maplocalleader_saved = g:maplocalleader
            endif
            let g:maplocalleader = b:tex_seven_leader

        " Now, implement user's customisations. In this case, override of
        " selected TeX-7 mappings.
        inoremap <buffer> <LocalLeader>e \varepsilon
        inoremap <buffer> <LocalLeader>_e \epsilon

        inoremap <buffer> <LocalLeader>_0 \emptyset
        inoremap <buffer> <LocalLeader>0 \varnothing


        " And lastly, revert <LocalLeader> to its previous setting, if any.
        if exists('s:maplocalleader_saved')
          let g:maplocalleader = s:maplocalleader_saved
        else
          unlet g:maplocalleader
        endif

7.2     Spell checking

        If you've enabled 'modeline', you may conveniently activate spell
        checking in your LaTeX documents by editing the modeline in the
        skeleton file.

        Example for anglophones: >

                % vim:tw=66 sw=2 ft=tex spell spelllang=en
<
        Notice that newer versions of Vim provide an option >

                let g:tex_comment_nospell=1

<       for disabling spell checking of comments that otherwise get messed up
       pretty badly.

7.3     Folding

        With newer versions of Vim it's easy as >

                let g:tex_fold_enabled = 1
